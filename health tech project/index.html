                Thus, it affects how we think, feel and act.
                In these days of excessive stress, people often avoid prioritizing their mental health, causing them to get affected mentally and physically with health ailments.
                We as a team thus have proposed to make this website to prioritize the mental health of users by taking a small quiz about what they feel and perceive about themselves and their surroundings to help them get over their mental ailments they are facing.

               <br>
               <br>
                So this is the website which makes you think about yourself and prioritize "YOU"!</p>
